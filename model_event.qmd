Event studies are a common approach in econometrics to assess the impact of an event such as earnings announcements, mergers and acquisitions, regulatory changes, or macroeconomic news.

The goal is to estimate the portion of post-event change that can be attributed to the event itself, isolating it from other market and firm-specific effects. We do this by predicting what would have happened if the event had not occurred (the counterfactual) and comparing it to the actual observed data to estimate the resulting *abnormal returns* (AR).

### Estimation and Observation Data

Following the process described by @HuntingtonKlein [chap 17.2.1], we pick an "estimation period" and an "observation period" from just before the event to the period of interest after the event.

The observation period includes 1 quarter before so we can determine if borrowers anticipate the event. This possibility was speculated in @sec-partners as we saw some fluctuation in credit card measures before the acquisition. 

The observation period chosen is 4 quarters after the event as the event impact may be after the acquisition  borrowers get their new partner cards after the acquisition.

### Sense check

The joint test problem arises because we are effectively testing two things: the counterfactual model and the event impact. Consequently, we need an approach to accurately evaluate if our counterfactual model results are credible. One approach suggested by @HuntingtonKlein is to test using observations where we expect no effect; if there were resulting "abnormal returns" this would point to an issue with the model.

This is in addition to visual, cross-validation and statistical checks on model fit.
