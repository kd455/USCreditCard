Event studies are a common approach in econometrics to assess the impact of an event such as earnings announcements, mergers and acquisitions, regulatory changes, or macroeconomic news.

The goal is to estimate the portion of post-event change that can be attributed to the event itself, isolating it from other market and firm-specific effects. We do this by predicting what would have happened if the event had not occurred (the counterfactual) and comparing it to the actual observed data to estimate the resulting *abnormal returns* (AR).

## Estimation and Observation Data {#sec-data-split}

Following the process described by @HuntingtonKlein [chap 17.2.1], we pick an "estimation period" and an "observation period".

The observation period chosen is the quarter of the event + 5 quarters after the event. Based on partnership agreement the portfolio can be transferred with delinquent borrowers on day one [e.g., @gap2021] or the impact may be some quarters after the acquisition as borrowers receive and start using their new partner cards. It will take least 30 days to determine if any of these borrowers are delinquent.
