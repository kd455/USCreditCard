# Introduction


## Objectives {#objectives}

This project focuses on the US credit card market and whether, using
publicly available data, we can independently assess Bank's credit card partnership deals.

Structurally, the US credit card market is split between 'bank branded'
(\~60%) and partnership cards (\~40%). Partnership cards e.g., with
Cosco, GAP, American Airlines etc. typically reward borrowers with
benefits such as points, services and discounts.

Each partnership card has a minimum FICO® Score cutoff for applicants.
FICO® is a US credit Card scoring system; low scores indicate increased
likelihood of a borrowers defaulting on their credit card loan.

-   **Hypotheses 1**: Adding a partnership with lower FICO® Score
    cutoff reduces the Bank's overall credit card portfolio quality.

-   **Hypotheses 2**: The sector e.g., retail, energy, airline, of a
    partnership card is a determinant of the partnership quality.

The project findings could be used in risk assessments of new Bank card
partnerships by external parties including regulators (internally, Banks
will have access to granular individual borrower level data to perform a
more through risk assessment).

### Partnership events {#sec-intro-events}

An attribute of the partnership market is that an established
partnership can breakdown, and the whole partner portfolio moves to a
new Bank. This means there are two opportunities to understand the
quality of the partner portfolio by looking for changepoints in the
"from" and "to" Bank. A changepoint may only be evident if:

1.  The deal is proportionally significant.
2.  There is a quality difference; if the quality of the portfolio stays
    same in both "from" and "to" Bank then we will not see a
    changepoint.

In comparison, new partnerships see a gradual increase in borrowers,
making it difficult to confidently attribute changes due to a
partnership verses macroeconomic factors and other
business decisions made by the Bank.
