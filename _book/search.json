supposed to be an effect, and we test for an effect, we can’t tease apart what part of our findings is the effect, and what part is the counterfactual model being wrong. But what if we knew there were no effect? Then, anything we estimated could only be the counterfactual model being wrong. So if we got an effect under those conditions, we’d know our model was fishy and would have to try something else.\nSo, get a bunch of different time series to test, especially those unaffected by the event. In the context of stock returns, for example, don’t just include the firm with the great announcement on a certain day, also include stocks for a bunch of other firms that had no announcement.\nThen, start doing your event study over and over again. Except each time you do it, pick a random time series to do it on, and pick a random day when the “event” is supposed to have happened.21\n\n\nCode\nselected_measure |&gt;\n    as_tibble() |&gt;\n    filter(LargeBank==1|LargeCreditCardBank==1) |&gt;\n    left_join(partners, relationship = \"many-to-many\") |&gt;\n    rename(value_diff.Bank = value_diff) |&gt;\n    mutate(Period = Quarter - yearquarter(acquired)) \n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(BankName)`\n\n\n# A tibble: 1,994 × 17\n    IDRSSD BankName          Measure Label Description Value LargeBank OtherBank\n     &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n 1 3284070 ALLY BANK (32840… UBPRE5… LN_C… Credit Car…  1.05         1         0\n 2 3284070 ALLY BANK (32840… UBPRE5… LN_C… Credit Car…  1.35         1         0\n 3 3284070 ALLY BANK (32840… UBPRE5… LN_C… Credit Car…  1.47         1         0\n 4 3284070 ALLY BANK (32840… UBPRE5… LN_C… Credit Car…  2.1          1         0\n 5 3284070 ALLY BANK (32840… UBPRE5… LN_C… Credit Car…  2.38         1         0\n 6 3284070 ALLY BANK (32840… UBPRE5… LN_C… Credit Car…  2.38         1         0\n 7 3284070 ALLY BANK (32840… UBPRE5… LN_C… Credit Car…  2.79         1         0\n 8 1394676 AMERICAN EXPRESS… UBPRE5… LN_C… Credit Car…  1.74         0         1\n 9 1394676 AMERICAN EXPRESS… UBPRE5… LN_C… Credit Car…  1.93         0         1\n10 1394676 AMERICAN EXPRESS… UBPRE5… LN_C… Credit Car…  1.6          0         1\n# ℹ 1,984 more rows\n# ℹ 9 more variables: LargeCreditCardBank &lt;int&gt;, Quarter &lt;qtr&gt;,\n#   value_scaled &lt;dbl[,1]&gt;, value_diff.Bank &lt;dbl&gt;, name &lt;chr&gt;, acquired &lt;date&gt;,\n#   available &lt;date&gt;, partnership &lt;chr&gt;, Period &lt;dbl&gt;"

    "text": "1.1 Objectives\nThis project focuses on the US credit card market and whether, using publicly available data, we can independently assess Bank’s credit card partnership deals.\nStructurally, the US credit card market is split between ‘bank branded’ (~60%) and partnership cards (~40%). Partnership cards e.g., with Cosco, GAP, American Airlines etc. typically reward borrowers with benefits such as points, services and discounts.\nEach partnership card has a minimum FICO® Score cutoff for applicants. FICO® is a US credit Card scoring system; low scores indicate increased likelihood of a borrowers defaulting on their credit card loan.\n\nHypotheses 1: Adding a partnership with lower FICO® Score cutoff reduces the Bank’s overall credit card portfolio quality.\nHypotheses 2: The sector e.g., retail, energy, airline, of a partnership card is a determinant of the partnership quality.\n\nThe project findings could be used in risk assessments of new Bank card partnerships by external parties including regulators (internally, Banks will have access to granular individual borrower level data to perform a more through risk assessment).\n\n1.1.1 Partnership events\nAn attribute of the partnership market is that an established partnership can breakdown, and the whole partner portfolio moves to a new Bank. This means there are two opportunities to understand the quality of the partner portfolio by looking for changepoints in the “from” and “to” Bank. A changepoint may only be evident if:\n\nThe deal is proportionally significant.\nThere is a quality difference; if the quality of the portfolio stays same in both “from” and “to” Bank then we will not see a changepoint.\n\nIn comparison, new partnerships see a gradual increase in borrowers, making it difficult to confidently attribute changes due to a partnership verses macroeconomic factors and other business decisions made by the Bank.\n Source: Javelin Report"

Table 2.2 shows the number of firms that have reported the measure “Credit Card Plans-30-89 DAYS P/D %” (UBPRE524) split into 3 peer groups.\nAdditionally, the partnership deals that we will be looking at occur between Large Banks e.g., JP Morgan and Large Credit Card Banks e.g., Barclays.\n\n\nCode\noverdue30to89 &lt;- credit_card.overdue_3089()\nbank_scope &lt;- overdue30to89 |&gt; \n                as_tibble() |&gt; \n                group_by(BankName,BankType) |&gt; \n                summarise(total_bal = sum(abs(Value),na.rm=T)) |&gt;\n                filter(!(is.na(total_bal)|total_bal==0))\n\nbank_scope |&gt;\n    group_by(BankType) |&gt; \n    summarise(Number = n()) |&gt; \n    mutate(Description = case_when(\n                    BankType == 'LargeBank' ~ \"Insured commercial banks having assets greater than $100 billion(defined by FFIEC as Peer Group 1)\",\n                    BankType == 'LargeCreditCardBank' ~ \"Large Credit Card Banks: Credit card specialty banks having assets greater than $ 3 billion (defined by FFIEC as Peer Group 201)\",\n                    .default = \"Other - all other Banks that have reported UBPRE524\"))|&gt; \n    knitr::kable(format = \"html\")    \n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Number of Banks in each peer group\n\n\nBankType\nNumber\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nLargeBank\n22\nInsured commercial banks having assets greater than $100 billion(defined by FFIEC as Peer Group 1)\n\n\nLargeCreditCardBank\n7\nLarge Credit Card Banks: Credit card specialty banks having assets greater than $ 3 billion (defined by FFIEC as Peer Group 201)\n\n\nOtherBank\n1257\nOther - all other Banks that have reported UBPRE524\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Outliers\n\n\n2.1.2 Regulation and impact on delinquency\nFigure 2.1 exposes some characteristics of our measure of interest: “Credit Card Plans-30-89 DAYS P/D %”:\n\nFigure 2.1 (a) Bank Type have different intercepts and data patterns; we need to account for this heterogeneity.\nFigure 2.1 (b) The variance for Large Banks and Large Credit Card Banks have reduced post regulatory changes in 2010. These were:\n\nCredit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009 which had a staggered implementation in February and August 2010. This Act has led to stricter lending criteria e.g., income and credit history checks, as it requires Banks to assess whether a potential borrower has the means to repay. High-risk borrowers like those under 21, have additional restrictions (FED 2010).\nRegulation Z, or the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), focuses on ensuring transparency and fairness in lending practices (CFPB 2023). For credit cards this means Banks have to provide full disclosure of the terms and conditions of a credit agreement.\n\nFigure 2.1 (c) The plot suggests there was increasing delinquency for Large Banks and Large Credit Card Banks, but post regulation the trend has reversed as is now trending down.\n\n\n\nCode\nreg_date_z &lt;- as.Date(\"2010-07-01\")\nreg_date_c1 &lt;- as.Date(\"2010-02-22\")\nreg_date_c2 &lt;- as.Date(\"2010-08-22\")\n\ngroup.colours &lt;- c(LargeBank = \"#1B9E77\", \n                    \"LargeBank/Before\" = \"#1B9E77\", \n                    \"LargeBank/After\" = \"#1B9E77\", \n                    LargeCreditCardBank = \"#D95F02\",\n                    \"LargeCreditCardBank/Before\" = \"#D95F02\", \n                    \"LargeCreditCardBank/After\" =  \"#D95F02\", \n                    OtherBank = \"#999999\",\n                    \"OtherBank/Before\" = \"#999999\",\n                    \"OtherBank/After\" = \"#999999\")\n\noverdue30to89 |&gt;

In that case, one good tool is an event study design implemented with regression.\nThe basic idea is this: estimate one regression of the outcome on the time period before the event. Then estimate another time series of the outcome on the time period after the event. Then see how the two are different."

These were:\n\nCredit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009 which had a staggered implementation in February and August 2010. This Act has led to stricter lending criteria e.g., income and credit history checks, as it requires Banks to assess whether a potential borrower has the means to repay. High-risk borrowers like those under 21, have additional restrictions (FED 2010).\nRegulation Z, or the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), focuses on ensuring transparency and fairness in lending practices. For credit cards this means Banks have to provide full disclosure of the terms and conditions of a credit agreement (CFPB 2023).\n\nFigure 2.1 (c) The plot suggests there was increasing delinquency for Large Banks and Large Credit Card Banks, but post regulation the trend has reversed as is now trending down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDecision to use post-regulatory data.\nThis prioritises analysis on newer, post-regulatory, credit card partnerships which is more relevant for commenting on future partnership deals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCFPB. 2023. “12 CFR Part 1026 - Truth in Lending (Regulation z).” Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1026/.\n\n\nEconomist. 2023. “Why America Has so Many Banks.” Economist. https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/05/26/why-america-has-so-many-banks.\n\n\nFED. 2010. “Federal Reserve Approves Final Rules to Protect Credit Card Users from a Number of Costly Practices.” Federal Reserve Board. https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20100112a.htm.\n\n\nFFIEC. 2023. “Central Data Repository.” Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. https://cdr.ffiec.gov/."

    "text": "2.2 Bank Peer Groups\nThe scope of Banks included in our analysis is not limited to the banks involved in credit card partnerships. We can use data from FFIEC to add information about their peers i.e. other banks that are similar.\nTable 2.2 details 3 peer groups. National (US-wide) Credit card partnerships occur between banks in the Large Bank and Large Credit Card Bank groups. These peer groups are defined by FFIEC (see Section 3.1 for full list of Banks in each peer group) (FFIEC 2023).\nA Large Bank like CITIBANK will have a multiple businesses: household mortgages and credit cards; market trading; investment banking and more. In contrast, large credit card banks like BARCLAYS US specialise in credit cards only. Consequently, we expect to see the peer groups react differently to external factors, or exhibit different internal dynamics and risk profiles.\n\n\nCode\noverdue30to89 &lt;- credit_card.overdue_3089()\ntarget_label &lt;- credit_card.target_label()\n\nbank_scope &lt;- overdue30to89 |&gt; \n                as_tibble() |&gt; \n                group_by(BankName,BankType) |&gt; \n                summarise(total_bal = sum(abs(Value),na.rm=T)) |&gt;\n                filter(!(is.na(total_bal)|total_bal==0))\n\nbank_n &lt;- bank_scope |&gt;\n            group_by(BankType) |&gt; \n            summarise(Number = n())\n\nbank_n |&gt; right_join(bank_type.desc()) |&gt; relocate(Number, .after = last_col()) |&gt;  \n            knitr::kable(format = \"html\")    \n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Number of Banks in each peer group\n\n\nBankType\nPeerId\nCriteria\nExamples\nNumber\n\n\n\n\nLargeBank\n1\nInsured commercial banks having assets greater than $100 billion\nCITIBANK, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, MORGAN STANLEY\n22\n\n\nLargeCreditCardBank\n201\nLarge Credit Card Banks: Credit card specialty banks having assets greater than $ 3 billion\nBARCLAYS BANK, SYNCHRONY BANK, DISCOVER BANK\n7\n\n\nOtherBank\n\nOther - all other Banks that have reported UBPRE524\n\n1257\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy are there thousands of Banks?

    "text": "2.3 Data Period\nRegulation implemented in 2010 had a material impact on the credit card market (CFPB 2013; also Jambulapati and Stavins 2013). As highlighted by Jambulapati and Stavins (2013), regulation coincided with the 2008 financial crisis and recession, making it difficult to fully assert causation (2013).\nThe regulations introduced were:\n\nCredit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009 which had a staggered implementation in February and August 2010. This Act requires Banks to assess whether a potential borrower has the means to repay. Additionally, high-risk borrowers like those under 21, have additional restrictions. This has led to stricter lending criteria e.g., income and credit history checks (CFPB 2013).\nRegulation Z, or the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), focuses on ensuring transparency and fairness in lending practices. Banks have to provide full disclosure of the terms and conditions of a loan agreement (CFPBb 2023).\n\nWe can see the impact in Figure 2.1 which plots a linear trend for Credit Card Plans-30-89 DAYS P/D % for each peer group. Based on Figure 2.1 (c) there was increasing delinquency for Large Banks and Large Credit Card Banks before regulation, but post regulation the trend has reversed and is now trending down.\nFor our analysis we will focus on credit card partnerships post regulation as this is more relevant for commenting on future partnership deals.\n\n\nCode\nreg_date_z &lt;- as.Date(\"2010-07-01\")\nreg_date_c1 &lt;- as.Date(\"2010-02-22\")\nreg_date_c2 &lt;- as.Date(\"2010-08-22\")\n\noverdue30to89 |&gt; \n    filter(value_diff &lt;= 23) |&gt;\n    group_by(BankType) |&gt;\n        summarise(val_mean = mean(Value, na.rm=T)) |&gt; \n        autoplot(val_mean, aes(colour=BankType)) +\n        geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, show.legend = F, linewidth=.5) +    \n        scale_color_manual(values = bank_type.colours())+\n        theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n                legend.title=element_blank()) +\n        labs(y=glue(\"{target_label} \\n mean\"), x=\"\")\n\noverdue30to89 |&gt; \n    filter(value_diff &lt;= 23) |&gt;\n    group_by(BankType) |&gt; summarise(variance = var(Value)) |&gt; \n    autoplot(variance) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = reg_date_c1,linetype=2,colour=\"red\", hjust = 0.05) +\n    annotate(\"label\",label=\"i\", x=reg_date_c1, y=20.0) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = reg_date_z,linetype=2,colour=\"red\") +\n    annotate(\"label\",label=\"ii\", x=reg_date_z, y=18.0) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = reg_date_c2,linetype=2,colour=\"red\") +\n    annotate(\"label\",label=\"iii\", x=reg_date_c2, y=16.0, hjust = - 0.05) +\n    labs(y=glue(\"{target_label} \\n variance\"), x=\"\") +\n    scale_color_manual(values = bank_type.colours())+\n    theme(legend.position = \"top\", legend.title=element_blank()) \n\n\noverdue30to89 |&gt; \n    filter(value_diff &lt;= 23) |&gt;\n    mutate(regulation = ifelse(as.Date(Quarter) &lt; reg_date_c1, 'Before', 'After')) |&gt; \n        group_by(BankType, regulation) |&gt;\n        summarise(val_mean = mean(Value, na.rm=T)) |&gt; \n        autoplot(val_mean, aes(colour=BankType)) +\n        geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, show.legend = F,size=.5) +    \n        scale_color_manual(values = bank_type.colours(), breaks=c(\"LargeBank\",\"LargeCreditCardBank\",\"OtherBank\"))+\n        geom_vline(xintercept = reg_date_c1,linetype=2,colour=\"red\")+\n        annotate(\"label\",label=\"CARD Act Part 1 comes into effect\", x=reg_date_c1, y=3.5, hjust = - 0.05) +\n        labs(y=glue(\"{target_label} \\n mean\"), x=\"\") +\n        theme(legend.position = \"top\", legend.title=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Bank Type have different intercepts and data patterns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Variance pre and post Regulation (i) - CARD Act part 1 (ii) - Regulation Z and (iii) Card Act part 2 The variance for Large Banks and Large Credit Card Banks have reduced post regulatory changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Linear trend pre and post Regulation.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Impact of Regulation"

We can see the mean in Figure 2.1 (b) where Other Banks variance did not appear to be as impacted by regulatory changes though they were subject to the same regulation.\nFigure 2.2 (c) Large Credit Card Banks are noticably more seasonal.\nFigure 2.2 (d) and Figure 2.2 (e) indicates a strong linear trend for Large and Large Credit Card Banks.\nFigure 2.2 (f) Autocorrelation coefficient close to 0 indicates weak or no linear relationship between lagged values. Of note the coefficients are negative indicating a tendency for a short-term reversal.\nFigure 2.2 (g) Credit Card Plans-30-89 DAYS P/D % (UBPRE524) for Large Credit Card Banks is not stationary. However, a single difference i.e. to get the quarterly change in UBPRE524, makes the series stationary.\n\n\n2.4.1 Outliers\nWhat is clear is that the Other appears to be a very different population from the Large Bank and Large Credit Card Bank peer groups. Consequently, unless we see partnerships between Other banks, this group will be uninformative for our analysis so can be dropped.\nFocusing on the Large Bank and Large Credit Card Bank, we can see that\nAs we are dealing with time series data, we need to identify outliers based on their distinct patterns or behaviors that deviate significantly from the typical trend observed throughout the series.\nAn approach by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2021) is to use Principal Components Analysis on combined features.

We also see that, post differencing, the autocorrelation coefficient at lag 2 is above the significance threshold. This is likely due to seasonality as there are larger coefficients at regular intervals - lags 2, 6, 10, and 14.
