the mean of the peer groups (Large Banks and Large Credit Card Banks) shows changes that may be due to all Banks rather than due to the partnership. 

##Means-adjusted model

Take the average of the target variable in the estimation period before the partnership event.

In the observation period, subtract the prediction from the actual return to get the “abnormal return.” AR
AR nonzero 
 values after the event give the effect of the event on the target variable
What if you’re interested in an event that changes the time series in a long-lasting way? In that case, one good tool is an event study design implemented with regression.

The basic idea is this: estimate one regression of the outcome on the time period before the event. Then estimate another time series of the outcome on the time period after the event. Then see how the two are different.

###Stationarity

Stationarity
If the variables of interest (both dependent and independent) exhibit trends or unit roots, there's a risk of encountering spurious relationships.
