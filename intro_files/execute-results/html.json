Partnership cards e.g., with\nCosco, GAP, American Airlines etc. typically reward borrowers with\nbenefits such as points, services and discounts.\n\nEach partnership card has a minimum FICO® Score cutoff for applicants.\nFICO® is a US credit Card scoring system; low scores indicate increased\nlikelihood of a borrowers defaulting on their credit card loan.\n\n-   **Hypotheses 1**: Adding a partnership card with lower FICO® Score\n    cutoff reduces the credit card portfolio quality.\n\n-   **Hypotheses 2**: The sector e.g., retail, energy, airline, of a\n    partnership card is a determinant of the credit card portfolio\n    quality.\n\nThe project findings could be used in risk assessments of new Bank card\npartnerships by external parties including regulators (internally, Banks\nwill have access to granular individual borrower level data to perform a\nmore through risk assessment).\n\n### Partnership changepoints\n\nAn attribute of the partnership market is that an established\npartnership can breakdown, and the whole partner portfolio moves to a\nnew Bank. This means there are two opportunities to understand the\nquality of the partner portfolio by looking for changepoints in the\n\"from\" and \"to\" Bank. A changepoint may only be evident if:\n\n1.  The deal is proportionally significant\n2.  There is a quality difference; if the quality of the portfolio stays\n    same in both \"from\" and \"to\" Bank then we will not see a\n    changepoint.\n\nIn comparison, new partnerships see a gradual increase in borrowers,\nmaking it difficult to confidently attribute changes due to a\npartnership change verses macroeconomic factors and other\nbusiness decisions make by the Bank.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Partnership card breakups. *Source:* [Javelin Report](https://javelinstrategy.com/research/co-branded-credit-cards-reinventing-themselves-post-covid-losses)](images/Mercator-Advisory-Group-Co-branded-Credit-Cards-EXHIBITS-Aug2021.jpg){fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n",
