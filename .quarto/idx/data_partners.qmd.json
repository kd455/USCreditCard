There are two dates of interest; the official date of acquisition and the date when cards become available for use. For example, Baclays's acquisition of GAP Inc. was on May 1, 2022 but it wasn't until June 20, 2022 that the old Synchrony borrowers could use their new Barclays partnership cards.\n\nAs mentioned in section @sec-intro-events we may not noticeably see the impact of a partnership event if it is not material to one or both of the Banks involved. To get a sense of the magnitude of the event we can look at the measures: *Loans to Individuals..Credit Cards* (UBPRB538) and *Unused commitments on Credit Credit Cards* (UBPR3815). These measures can tell us if borrowers utilise their partnership card; a new partnership that brings in substantial number of new borrowers may not impact delinquency if the borrowers are not using the partnership card. \n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n#| output: false\n#| eval: false\n\napply_bank_filters = TRUE\napply_reg_filter = TRUE\n\noverdue30to89 <- credit_card.overdue_3089(apply_bank_filters, apply_reg_filter)\nloan_amt <-  credit_card.loan_amount(apply_bank_filters, apply_reg_filter)\nloan_unused <- credit_card.unused(apply_bank_filters, apply_reg_filter)\nloan_amt_pct_change <- loan_amt |> group_by(BankName) |> mutate(pct_change = value_diff/lag(Value) *100) \nloan_unused_pct_change <- loan_unused |> group_by(BankName) |> mutate(pct_change = value_diff/lag(Value) *100) \n\npartner_data <- credit_card.partnerships() \n\npartner_data |> pmap(partnership.plot,overdue30to89, \"Value\", \"median\")\npartner_data |> pmap(partnership.plot,overdue30to89, \"value_diff\", \"median\")\npartner_data |> pmap(partnership.plot,bind_rows(loan_amt,loan_unused), \"Value\", \"median\")\npartner_data |> pmap(partnership.plot,bind_rows(loan_amt_pct_change,loan_unused_pct_change), \"pct_change\", \"median\")\n\n```\n\n\n::: {#fig-3089days .panel-tabset}\n\n## Gap\n\n![`r target_label`](images/GAP_UBPRE524_Value_median_partnership.png){#fig-gap-val}\n\n![`r target_label` quarterly difference](images/GAP_UBPRE524_value_diff_median_partnership.png){#fig-gap-diff}\n\n::: {#fig-magitude-gap .panel-tabset}\n\n## Magnitude Measures - Value\n\n![Magnitude Measures](images/GAP_UBPR3815_UBPRB538_Value_median_partnership.png){#fig-gap-val-mag}\n\n## Magnitude Measures - Percentage Change\n![Magnitude Measures](images/GAP_UBPR3815_UBPRB538_pct_change_median_partnership.png){#fig-gap-pct-mag}\n\n:::\n\nsource: [@gap2021; and @gap2022]\n\n## Cosco\n\n![`r target_label`](images/Cosco_UBPRE524_Value_median_partnership.png){#fig-cosco-val}\n\n![`r target_label` quarterly difference](images/Cosco_UBPRE524_value_diff_median_partnership.png){#fig-cosco-diff}\n\n::: {#fig-magitude-cosco .panel-tabset}\n\n## Magnitude Measures - Value\n\n![Magnitude Measures](images/Cosco_UBPR3815_UBPRB538_Value_median_partnership.png){#fig-cosco-val-mag}\n\n## Magnitude Measures - Percentage Change\n\n![Magnitude Measures](images/Cosco_UBPR3815_UBPRB538_pct_change_median_partnership.png){#fig-cosco-pct-mag}\n\n:::\n\nsource: @cosco2016\n\n## Walmart\n![`r target_label`](images/Walmart_UBPRE524_Value_median_partnership.png){#fig-walmart-val}\n\n![`r target_label` quarterly difference](images/Walmart_UBPRE524_value_diff_median_partnership.png){#fig-cosco-diff}\n\n::: {#fig-magitude-walmart .panel-tabset}\n\n## Magnitude Measures - Value\n\n![Magnitude Measures](images/Walmart_UBPR3815_UBPRB538_Value_median_partnership.png){#fig-walmart-val-mag}\n\n## Magnitude Measures - Percentage Change\n\n![Magnitude Measures](images/Walmart_UBPR3815_UBPRB538_pct_change_median_partnership.png){#fig-walmart-pct-mag}\n\n:::\nsource: [@walmart2018; and @walmart2019]\n:::\n\n## Disambiguating Trend vs. Event \n\nDepending on the relative quality of the partnership portfolio we may see `r target_label` remain: \n\n* Stable\n* Both portfolios improve / degrade\n* One improves the other degrades.\n\nFor the GAP and Cosco partnerships we can see that the quality degrades i.e. *`r target_label`* shows increased delinquency, in both the *old* and *new* bank during the transitional period (between acquisition and card availability).
