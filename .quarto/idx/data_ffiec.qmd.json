For credit cards this means Banks have to provide full disclosure of the terms and conditions of a credit agreement [@cfpb2010z].\n\nWe can see the impact in @fig-regulation which plots a linear trend for **Credit Card Plans-30-89 DAYS P/D %** (UBPRE524) for each peer group. Based on @fig-regulation-3 there was increasing delinquency for Large Banks and Large Credit Card Banks before regulation, but post regulation the trend has reversed and is now trending down.\n\nFor our analysis we will focus on the post regulatory period. This does mean that we will reduce our analysis to credit card partnerships post regulation, however, this is more relevant for commenting on future partnership deals. \n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n#| label: fig-regulation\n#| fig-cap: \"Impact of Regulation\"\n#| fig-subcap: \n#|   - \"Bank Type have different intercepts and data patterns\"\n#|   - \"Variance pre and post Regulation <br>(i) - CARD Act part 1 (ii) - Regulation Z and (iii) Card Act part 2 <br>The variance for Large Banks and Large Credit Card Banks have reduced post regulatory changes.\"\n#|   - \"Linear trend pre and post Regulation.\"\n#| layout-ncol: 1\nreg_date_z <- as.Date(\"2010-07-01\")\nreg_date_c1 <- as.Date(\"2010-02-22\")\nreg_date_c2 <- as.Date(\"2010-08-22\")\n\ngroup.colours <- c(LargeBank = \"#1B9E77\", \n                    \"LargeBank/Before\" = \"#1B9E77\", \n                    \"LargeBank/After\" = \"#1B9E77\", \n                    LargeCreditCardBank = \"#D95F02\",\n                    \"LargeCreditCardBank/Before\" = \"#D95F02\", \n                    \"LargeCreditCardBank/After\" =  \"#D95F02\", \n                    OtherBank = \"#999999\",\n                    \"OtherBank/Before\" = \"#999999\",\n                    \"OtherBank/After\" = \"#999999\")\n\noverdue30to89 |> \n    filter(value_diff <= 23) |>\n    group_by(BankType) |>\n        summarise(val_mean = mean(Value, na.rm=T)) |> \n        autoplot(val_mean, aes(colour=BankType)) +\n        geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, show.legend = F, linewidth=.5) +    \n        scale_color_manual(values = group.colours)+\n        theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n                legend.title=element_blank()) +\n        labs(y=glue(\"{target_label} \\n mean\"), x=\"\")\n\noverdue30to89 |> \n    filter(value_diff <= 23) |>\n    group_by(BankType) |> summarise(variance = var(Value)) |> \n    autoplot(variance) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = reg_date_c1,linetype=2,colour=\"red\", hjust = 0.05) +\n    annotate(\"label\",label=\"i\", x=reg_date_c1, y=20.0) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = reg_date_z,linetype=2,colour=\"red\") +\n    annotate(\"label\",label=\"ii\", x=reg_date_z, y=18.0) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = reg_date_c2,linetype=2,colour=\"red\") +\n    annotate(\"label\",label=\"iii\", x=reg_date_c2, y=16.0, hjust = - 0.05) +\n    labs(y=glue(\"{target_label} \\n variance\"), x=\"\") +\n    scale_color_manual(values = group.colours)+\n    theme(legend.position = \"top\", legend.title=element_blank()) \n\n\noverdue30to89 |> \n    filter(value_diff <= 23) |>\n    mutate(regulation = ifelse(as.Date(Quarter) < reg_date_c1, 'Before', 'After')) |> \n        group_by(BankType, regulation) |>\n        summarise(val_mean = mean(Value, na.rm=T)) |> \n        autoplot(val_mean, aes(colour=BankType)) +\n        geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, show.legend = F,size=.5) +    \n        scale_color_manual(values = group.colours, breaks=c(\"LargeBank\",\"LargeCreditCardBank\",\"OtherBank\"))+\n        geom_vline(xintercept = reg_date_c1,linetype=2,colour=\"red\")+\n        annotate(\"label\",label=\"CARD Act Part 1 comes into effect\", x=reg_date_c1, y=3.5, hjust = - 0.05) +\n        labs(y=glue(\"{target_label} \\n mean\"), x=\"\") +\n        theme(legend.position = \"top\", legend.title=element_blank())\n```\n## Bank Outliers {#sec-outliers}\n\nAs we are dealing with time series data, we need to identify banks where their individual data characteristics are markedly different from those of its peers.\n\n@fig-outliers takes the approach from @Hyndman2021 who use Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on a set of calculated statistical features such as lumpiness, stability and Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) [-@Hyndman2021]. \n \n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n#| error: false\n#| label: fig-outliers \n#| fig-cap: \"Outlier Detection using PCA\"\n#| fig-subcap:\n#|   - \"PCA for <span style='color:#1B9E77'>Large</span> and <span style='color:#D95F02'>Large Credit Card</span> Banks using features: lumpiness, stability and seasonal.

With the exception of Ally Bank the series start from 0 and quickly jump after one or two quarters. This is expected as it takes 30+ days for credit cards to become deliquient. \n\nIf we drop the first 2 non-zero quarters and re-run the PCA (see @fig-outliers-corrected) the banks are no longer outliers - indicating that it was that initial jump that was unusual.\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n#| error: false\n#| label: fig-outliers-corrected\n#| fig-cap: \"PCA of outliers after their first 2 non-zero quarters are dropped\"\noutlier_df <- overdue30to89_lbanks |> \n                filter(IDRSSD %in% outliers$IDRSSD, Value != 0) |>\n                tsibble::group_by_key() |> \n                        slice(3:n())\n                                    \nall_f_outliers <- outlier_df |> \n                    features(Value, feature_set(tags = c(\"lumpiness\",\"stability\",\"seasonal\")))\n\nall_f_outliers |> \n    mutate_if(is.numeric, replace_na, -1) |> #where we could not calc a feature value\n    select(-c(IDRSSD,BankName, Measure, Label, Description, BankType)) |>\n    prcomp(scale = TRUE) |> \n    broom::augment(all_f_outliers) |> plot_pcs()\n\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n#| error: false\n\n#apply 1. regulatory cutoff, 2. fixed outliers.\nfinal_df <- overdue30to89_post |> \n                filter(!IDRSSD %in% outliers$IDRSSD) |> \n                add_row(outlier_df) |> fill_gaps()\n\nall_ftbanks <- final_df |> \n                features(Value, feature_set(tags = c(\"lumpiness\",\"stability\",\"seasonal\")))\n```\n\n## Exploration of Statistical Features {#sec-feature-explore}\n\n@fig-lfeature shows the features from @sec-outliers that we can use to explore the characteristics of each peer group (see [@tsfeatures]). \n\nThe *Other Banks* peer group has been added for interest. \n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n#| error: false\n#| label: fig-lfeature\n#| fig-cap: \"Exploring Statistical Features (Post Regulatory environment)\"\n#| fig-subcap:\n#|   - \"Lumpiness - variance of the variances based on tiled (non-overlapping) windows\"\n#|   - \"Stability - the variance of the means based on tiled (non-overlapping) windows\"\n#|   - \"STL decomposition Seasonal Strength - 0 is week (non-seasonal), 1 is strong\"\n#|   - \"STL decomposition Trend Strength - 0 is week (no trend), 1 is strong\"\n#|   - \"Linearity -  values around 0 indicate the series is linear\"\n#|   - \"Autocorrelation - first autocorrelation coefficient\"\n#|   - \"Minimum number of differences necessary to obtain a stationary time series\"\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\nplot_feature_violin <- function(data, feature_name) {\n    data |>\n        ggplot(aes(x = BankType, y = !!as.name(feature_name))) +\n                    geom_violin(trim = FALSE) +\n                    geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = \"white\") + \n                    theme_light() +\n                    labs(x = \"\", y = \"\")\n}\n\nplot_feature_violin(all_ftbanks, \"var_tiled_var\")\n\nplot_feature_violin(all_ftbanks, \"var_tiled_mean\")\n\nplot_feature_violin(all_ftbanks, \"seasonal_strength_year\")\n\nplot_feature_violin(all_ftbanks, \"trend_strength\")\n\nplot_feature_violin(all_ftbanks, \"linearity\")\n\nplot_feature_violin(all_ftbanks, \"stl_e_acf1\")\n\nplot_feature_violin(all_ftbanks, \"nsdiffs\")\n\n```\n\n1. @fig-lfeature-1: *Other Banks* are lumpy. Also we can see from @fig-regulation-2 that the variance of *Other Banks* did not significantly reduce, we still see lumpiness post regulatory changes (though they were subject to the same regulation). \n2. @fig-lfeature-3 *Large Credit Card* Banks are more seasonal. @fig-season shows both *Large Banks* and *Large Credit Card Banks* peak in Q3. This is surprising as I assumed events like Black Friday, Thanksgiving and Christmas would have a noticable impact in Q4 or Q1. \n3. @fig-lfeature-4 and @fig-lfeature-5 indicates a strong linear trend for *Large Banks* and *Large Credit Card Banks*.\n4. @fig-lfeature-6 Autocorrelation coefficient close to 0 indicates weak or no linear relationship between lagged values. Of note the coefficients are negative indicating a tendency for a short-term reversal. This can be seen in @fig-regulation-1 where the values oscillate.\n5. @fig-lfeature-7 *Large Credit Card Banks* is not stationary.
