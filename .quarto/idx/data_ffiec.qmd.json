These series begin at 0 and sharply increase after the first or second quarter. Considering it takes 30+ days for credit cards to become delinquent this pattern is expected. However, for modelling we may want to drop the first few quarters to remove the impact of this initial sharp increase and reflect the ongoing state.\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n#| error: false\n\nselected_feats = c(\"lumpiness\",\"stability\",\"seasonal\")\n\n#remove first 2 quarters (take from start of series)\ndf_alltypes <- overdue30to89 |> \n                tsibble::group_by_key() |> \n                filter(Value != 0) |>\n                slice(3:n()) |>\n                filter_index(regulation_cutoff ~ .) |>\n                fill_gaps()\n\nall_ftbanks <- df_alltypes |> \n                features(Value, feature_set(tags = selected_feats))\n\nfinal_df <- df_alltypes |> \n                filter(BankType %in% c(\"LargeBank\", \"LargeCreditCardBank\")) |>\n                mutate(value_diff = difference(Value))\n\n```\n## Exploration of Statistical Features {#sec-feature-explore}\n\n@fig-quantile plots the distribution of `r target_label`.

There are `r bank_n |> filter(BankType==\"LargeCreditCardBank\") |> pull(Number)` banks in the this peer group which may be too small to capture the true distribution effectively. However, it may also indicate that there are sub-groups within this peer group.

This can also be seen in the undulating shape in ACF plot (see @fig-acf-1). \n\n    @fig-season shows both *Large Banks* and *Large Credit Card Banks* peak in Q3.

Performing a difference i.e. to get the quarterly change in UBPRE524, makes the series stationary as shown in @fig-acf. This can be confirmed by performing an augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test on the differenced value. We also see that, post differencing, there are autocorrelation coefficients above the significance threshold. This is likely due to seasonality as these are at regular intervals. The decreasing magnitude of these coefficients tell us the earlier lags have a stronger influence than values further in the past.\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n#| error: false\n#| label: fig-acf\n#| fig-cap: \"ACF on original value (a) and first difference value (b)\"\n#| fig-subcap:\n#|   - \"\"\n#| layout-ncol: 2\nagg_df <- final_df |> \n            group_by(BankType)|> \n            summarise(mean_val = mean(Value, na.rm=T),\n                      mean_diff = mean(value_diff, na.rm=T)) \n       \nagg_df |> ACF(x=mean_val,lag_max = 42) |> autoplot()\nagg_df |> ACF(x=mean_diff,lag_max = 42) |> autoplot()\n\n```\n**Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test**\n\n::: {.border}\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n\nfinal_df |> na.omit() |> pull(value_diff) |> tseries::adf.test()\n```\n:::\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, based on exploration of the data we will prepare the data for modelling by:\n\n***Selecting:***\n\n1.
