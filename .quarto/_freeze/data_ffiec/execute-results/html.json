This is the sum of UBPRE523 and UBPRE524; accounts that are accruing payments but are overdue by 30 day+ or are in non-accrual status i.e. non-performing loans. \n\nHowever, given we are interested in the impact of a partnership, using only UBPRE524 **Credit Card Plans-30-89 DAYS P/D %** measure is ideal as it gives us the earliest indicator of delinquency.\n\n## Bank Peer Groups\n\nThe scope of Banks included in our analysis is not limited to the banks involved in credit card partnerships. We can use data from FFIEC to add information about their peers i.e. other banks that are similar. \n\n@tbl-peergrpcnt shows the 3 peer groups. National (US-wide) Credit card partnerships occur with Banks in the **Large Bank** and **Large Credit Card Bank** groups, membership of these peer groups are defined by FFIEC (See @sec-peers for full list of Banks in each peer group) [@ffiec].\n\nA Large Bank like CITIBANK will have a multiple businesses: household mortgages and credit cards; trading desks; investment banking; private wealth customers and more. In constrast specialised credit card business like BARCLAYS US are credit card only businesses. Consequently, we can expect to see the peer groups behave differently, and be affected differently by external factors, or exhibit different internal dynamics and risk profiles. Including the peer group in our models should help by modelling the peer group specific data characteristics. \n\n\n::: {#tbl-peergrpcnt .cell tbl-cap='Number of Banks in each peer group'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noverdue30to89 <- credit_card.overdue_3089()\nbank_scope <- overdue30to89 |> \n                as_tibble() |> \n                group_by(BankName,BankType) |> \n                summarise(total_bal = sum(abs(Value),na.rm=T)) |>\n                filter(!(is.na(total_bal)|total_bal==0))\n\n\ngrp <- tibble(BankType = 'LargeBank', FFIEC_Id = '1', Criteria = 'Insured commercial banks having assets greater than $100 billion', Examples = 'CITIBANK, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, MORGAN STANLEY') |> \nadd_row(BankType = 'LargeCreditCardBank', FFIEC_Id = '201', Criteria = 'Large Credit Card Banks: Credit card specialty banks having assets greater than $ 3 billion', Examples = 'BARCLAYS BANK, SYNCHRONY BANK, DISCOVER BANK')|> \nadd_row(BankType = 'OtherBank', FFIEC_Id = '', Criteria = 'Other - all other Banks that have reported UBPRE524', Examples = '')\n\nbank_scope |>\n    group_by(BankType) |> \n    summarise(Number = n()) |>\n    right_join(grp) |>    \n    knitr::kable(format = \"html\")    \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> BankType </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Number </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> FFIEC_Id </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Criteria </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Examples </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> LargeBank </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 22 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Insured commercial banks having assets greater than $100 billion </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> CITIBANK, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, MORGAN STANLEY </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> LargeCreditCardBank </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 201 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Large Credit Card Banks: Credit card specialty banks having assets greater than $ 3 billion </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> BARCLAYS BANK, SYNCHRONY BANK, DISCOVER BANK </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> OtherBank </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1257 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Other - all other Banks that have reported UBPRE524 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nWhy are there thousands of Banks? The US Banking system grew out of 19th-century regulations that restricted where banks could operate. This resulted in a very localised Banking market. Today big banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, dominate the industry but there are still about 4,100 US Banks compared with 353 in Britain and 261 in Germany [@economist2023]. \n:::\n\n## Data Period\n\nRegulation implemented in 2010 had a material impact on the credit card market [@cfpb2013] and [@boston2014]. It's worth noting that @boston2014 highlight that implemention coincided with the 2008 financial crisis and recession, making it difficult to assert changes solely to regulation change [-@boston2014].\n\nWe have to consider whether we should use the full time series (from 2002 Q4) or just the period post-regulatory change.\n\nThe regulations introduced were:\n1. Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009 which had a staggered implementation in February and August 2010. This Act has led to stricter lending criteria e.g., income and credit history checks, as it requires Banks to assess whether a potential borrower has the means to repay. High-risk borrowers like those under 21, have additional restrictions [@cfpb2013]. \n2. Regulation Z, or the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), focuses on ensuring transparency and fairness in lending practices. For credit cards this means Banks have to provide full disclosure of the terms and conditions of a credit agreement [@cfpb2010z].\n\nWe can see the impact in @fig-regulation which plots a linear trend for **Credit Card Plans-30-89 DAYS P/D %** (UBPRE524) for each peer group. Based on @fig-regulation-3 there was increasing delinquency for Large Banks and Large Credit Card Banks before regulation, but post regulation the trend has reversed and is now trending down.\n\nFor our analysis we will focus on the post regulatory period. This prioritises newer credit card partnerships which is more relevant for commenting on future partnership deals. \n\n\n::: {#fig-regulation .cell layout-ncol=\"1\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreg_date_z <- as.Date(\"2010-07-01\")\nreg_date_c1 <- as.Date(\"2010-02-22\")\nreg_date_c2 <- as.Date(\"2010-08-22\")\n\ngroup.colours <- c(LargeBank = \"#1B9E77\", \n                    \"LargeBank/Before\" = \"#1B9E77\", \n                    \"LargeBank/After\" = \"#1B9E77\", \n                    LargeCreditCardBank = \"#D95F02\",\n                    \"LargeCreditCardBank/Before\" = \"#D95F02\", \n                    \"LargeCreditCardBank/After\" =  \"#D95F02\", \n                    OtherBank = \"#999999\",\n                    \"OtherBank/Before\" = \"#999999\",\n                    \"OtherBank/After\" = \"#999999\")\n\noverdue30to89 |> \n    filter(value_diff <= 23) |>\n    group_by(BankType) |>\n        summarise(val_mean = mean(Value, na.rm=T)) |> \n        autoplot(val_mean, aes(colour=BankType)) +\n        geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, show.legend = F, size=.5) +    \n        scale_color_manual(values = group.colours)+\n        theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n                legend.title=element_blank()) +\n        labs(y=\"Credit Card Plans-30-89 DAYS P/D % \\n mean\", x=\"\")\n\noverdue30to89 |> \n    filter(value_diff <= 23) |>\n    group_by(BankType) |> summarise(variance = var(Value)) |> \n    autoplot(variance) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = reg_date_z,linetype=2,colour=\"red\") +\n    annotate(\"text\",label=\"Jul 2010 - Regulation Z\", x=reg_date_z, y=20.0, hjust = -0.05,size =11/ .pt) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = reg_date_c1,linetype=2,colour=\"red\") +\n    annotate(\"text\",label=\"Feb 2010 - CARD Act Part 1\", x=reg_date_c1, y=25.0, hjust = -0.05,size =11/ .pt) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = reg_date_c2,linetype=2,colour=\"red\") +\n    annotate(\"text\",label=\"Aug 2010 CARD Act Part 2\", x=reg_date_c2, y=15.0, hjust = -0.05,size =11/ .pt) +\n    labs(y=\"Credit Card Plans-30-89 DAYS P/D % \\n variance\", x=\"\") +\n    scale_color_manual(values = group.colours)+\n    theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n                legend.title=element_blank(),\n                ) \n\n\noverdue30to89 |> \n    filter(value_diff <= 23) |>\n    mutate(regulation = ifelse(as.Date(Quarter) < reg_date_c1, 'Before', 'After')) |> \n        group_by(BankType, regulation) |>\n        summarise(val_mean = mean(Value, na.rm=T)) |> \n        autoplot(val_mean, aes(colour=BankType)) +\n        geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, show.legend = F,size=.5) +    \n        scale_color_manual(values = group.colours, breaks=c(\"LargeBank\",\"LargeCreditCardBank\",\"OtherBank\"))+\n        geom_vline(xintercept = reg_date_c1,linetype=2,colour=\"darkgrey\")+\n        annotate(\"text\",label=\"CARD Act Part 1 comes into effect\", x=reg_date_c1, y=4.0, hjust = - 0.05,size =11/ .pt) +\n        theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n                legend.title=element_blank()) +\n        labs(y=\"Credit Card Plans-30-89 DAYS P/D % \\n mean\", x=\"\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bank Type have different intercepts and data patterns](data_ffiec_files/figure-html/fig-regulation-1.png){#fig-regulation-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Variance pre and post Regulation.
