In that case, one good tool is an event study design implemented with regression.\n\nThe basic idea is this: estimate one regression of the outcome on the time period before the event. Then estimate another time series of the outcome on the time period after the event. Then see how the two are different.\n\n## Bank Fixed Effect\n###Stationarity\n\nStationarity\nIf the variables of interest (both dependent and independent) exhibit trends or unit roots, there's a risk of encountering spurious relationships.\n",
